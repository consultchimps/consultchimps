# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when
exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, if it exists.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their
absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill
creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repo: one `CONTEXT.md` at the root and one `docs/adr/`
directory hold the domain vocabulary and decisions for every package.

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── 0001-feature-registry-and-drift-checks.md
└── packages/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal,
a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift
to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either
you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real
gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than
silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0001 (feature registry), but worth reopening because…_
